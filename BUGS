BUGS:
    1. The session keeps on expiring (check if this still persists)
    2. CSS sometimes doesn't load on new project, but loads on page reload. I'm thinking if it's a caching issue
    3. CSS Also doesn't load sometimes in projects page
    4. Project Page:
        -Always redirects to login when refreshing a protected route
        -Shows all bugs the user owns, but not specified to a specific project. needsbugs of a project
